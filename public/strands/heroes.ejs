     Heroes are the essential element of Dota 2, as the course of the game is dependent on them. During a match, 
     two opposing teams select five heroes that accumulate experience and gold. Once a hero has enough experience, it will level up,
     growing more powerful and gaining new abilities. Most heroes have a distinct role that defines them

    <h2>So who are they?</h2>
     <p>
      There are a total of 113 heroes in Dota 2. And they all have uniqure abilities you can click <a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Heroes"> here</a> for a 
      more comprehensive list, but here we'll give you a more brief overview of the heroes. There are three types of heroes. Strength, Agility and Intelegence. These 
      three atributes make up the base of a hero and generally give an idea of how the hero will be played. For example most heroes that have hight Intelegence start 
      the game with less Health and more Mana that heroes that have higher Strenght or Agility.

      <h3> Strength </h3>
       <p>      
        Strength heroes tend to have more health and health regeneration than heroes of other classes, making them more resilient to both physical attacks and spells. Strength heroes have the greatest variety in their roles, including that of carry, ganker, and support, but almost all of them have some form of strong initiation and are supposed to act as tanks to some degree. In addition, heroes with a large amount of strength may greatly increase the damage needed to bring a team down. With the exception of Huskar, Io, Phoenix and Dragon Knight in his Elder Dragon Form, all strength heroes are melee. Whilst Intelligence heroes typically sport a strong early game, and Agility heroes excel in the late game, Strength heroes are often able to strike a balance between the two and remain relevant at all points of the game.
        At the moment, there are 37 Strength Heroes implemented in Dota 2.

       <h3> Agility</h3>
       <p>
        Because Agility heroes are the only class of heroes to gain both damage and attack speed as their primary attribute increases, they tend to have the highest physical damage output as the game progresses. This makes them scale very well with offensive items. They tend to have limited disabling capabilities or nukes; almost all their abilities augment their physical capabilities or serve as positioning or escape mechanisms. This tends to make them a lot more vulnerable and weak in the early game when strong offensive disables and nukes dictate the flow of kills, but also means that, with good items under their belts, they will be the ones delivering the greatest amount of damage in the late game, while also being dealt the least amount of physical damage as a result of their high armor. Agility heroes have a roughly even split between being melee or being ranged, and fit primarily into carry and ganker roles.
        At the moment, there are 36 Agility Heroes implemented in Dota 2.

       <h3> Intelligence </h3>
       <p>
        Intelligence heroes tend to have a greater number of active abilities compared to heroes of other classes; with the exception of Necrophos, all Intelligence heroes have at least three active abilities, with a large number of them having all four of their abilities being actives. Their larger mana pools and higher mana regen rates go a long way to help them use these abilities frequently. As a whole, Intelligence heroes have by far the greatest number of disabling capabilities, making them essential in most lineups. The items they build also tend to be highly caster based, since those items primarily provide Intelligence. With the exceptions of Dark Seer and Ogre Magi, all Intelligence heroes are ranged. Because most Intelligence heroes have abilities such as static damage nukes that scale poorly, they tend to have a strong early game, when enemies' health pools are low, but a much weaker late game, when enemies have high health and strong defensive items. Because of this, they often fit into support and ganker roles.
        At the moment, there are 41 Intelligence Heroes implemented in Dota 2.
